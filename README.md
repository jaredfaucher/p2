## Description:

My project is an xkcd style password generator which have a few interesting features.  Using HTML, CSS and PHP I created a password generator where you can choose the number of words in the password, the separator (or camel case), whether to uppcase the first letter and whether to add a number or symbol to the end of the password.

## Details:

There are no details the instructor needs to know to run this application.

## Plugics/Libraries/Etc:

	- Bootstrap: http://getbootstrap.com/
	- Word List: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/wordlist/wordsEn.txt

The only outside sources I used directly for this project was Bootstrap v3.1.1 and a word list I found on Google.  I also used Google and Stack Overflow to find out how to do certain things (e.g. testing that the input to "Number of Words" was an integer") but I did not copy any code directly, just adapted it.
